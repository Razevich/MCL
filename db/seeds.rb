# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])

#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# admins = Admin.create([ {username: "admin"}, {password: "1234"} ])
# Admin.create(:username => 'admin', :password => '123')


# films = Film.create([ {title: "sample"}, {year: 1999}, {description: "blah"} ])

# rails g scaffold Tv year:integer title:text description:text img_url:text favorite:boolean
